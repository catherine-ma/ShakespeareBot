	Chips & Memories

Upon my astonishment, in earth seem,
Till thou remove the thoughts, chips, grew deface,
The skill o'erworn, pass be dismay esteem.
He countenance with every tend place
Year at memory style looks thou breathes prove.
Enjoyed themselves, so you brook, tipped being,
And for the pen spoil, in another love:
Sufferance love cloud rare with been seeing.
Contemplation as grace true his time whence still,
Him shamed & thine down before no love treasure,
The muse ye if for, tall secretly ill,
Betokening dates done travail pleasure,
Record is when like this heart, are please loss.
In my records corrupt if which stain cross.
